### Changed

- Update to Bevy 0.6
- Update to rust edition 2021
- Force Cargo resolver v2
- Replaced `ColorMaterialColorLens` with `SpriteColorLens` since the color of a `Sprite` is now an intrinsic property of the component, and does not use materials anymore. Users wanting to animate a `ColorMaterial::color` can create a custom lens.
